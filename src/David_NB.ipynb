MSAs are designated by counties, the smallest geographic units for which a wide range of statistical data can be attained. However, in New England, MSAs are designated by cities and towns because these subcounty units are of great local significance and considerable data are available for them. Currently, an area is defined as an MSA if it meets one of two standards: (1) a city has a population of at least 50,000 residents, and (2) the Census Bureau defines an urbanized area of at least 50,000 people with a total metropolitan population of at least 100,000 (or 75,000 in New England). The Census Bureau's definition of urbanized areas, data on commuting to work, and the strength of the economic and social ties between the surrounding counties and the central city determine which counties not containing a main city are included in an MSA. For New England, MSAs are determined by a core area and related cities and towns, not counties. An MSA may contain more than one city of 50,000 residents and may cross state lines.</description><id>msa</id><name>Location of residence</name><values><description>Urban</description><name>1</name></values><values><description>Suburban</description><name>2</name></values><values><description>Rural</description><name>3</name></values></fields><fields><description>One of the following classifications (1) married, which includes persons in common-law unions and those who are currently living apart for reasons other than marital discord (e.g., employment and military service); (2) separated or divorced, which includes married persons who are legally separated and those who are not living together because of marital discord; (3) widowed; and (4) never married, which includes persons whose marriages have been annulled and those who are living together and not in a common-law union.</description><id>marital2</id><name>Marital status</name><values><description>Never married</description><name>1</name></values><values><description>Married</description><name>2</name></values><values><description>Widowed</description><name>3</name></values><values><description>Divorced</description><name>4</name></values><values><description>Separated</description><name>5</name></values></fields><fields><description>Victims who were injured during an incident are asked whether they received any medical care for their injuries.

Murder is not measured by the NCVS because of an inability to question the victim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rape: Unlawful penetration of a person against the will of the victim, with use or threatened use of force, or attempting such an act. Includes psychological coercion and physical force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the offender. Also includes incidents where penetration is from a foreign object, such as a bottle. Includes male and female victims, and both heterosexual and same sex rape. Attempted rape includes verbal threats of rape. (Rape and sexual assault are combined into one victimization measure.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sexual assault: A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or attempted rape.

Sexual assault may or may not involve force and include grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats. (Rape and sexual assault are combined into one victimization measure.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robbery: The unlawful taking or attempted taking of property that is in the immediate possession of another, by force or threat of force, with or without a weapon, and with or without injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aggravated assault: An attack or attempted attack with a weapon, with or without injury, or an attack without a weapon when serious injury results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simple assault: An attack or attempted attack without a weapon that results in either no injury, minor injury (e.g., bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches, or swelling) or an undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personal theft: Includes purse snatching or pocket picking, which is the theft or attempted theft of property or cash directly from the victim by stealth, without force or threat of force.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>newoff</id><name>Type of crime</name><values><description>Rape/sexual assault</description><name>1</name></values><values><description>Robbery</description><name>2</name></values><values><description>Aggravated assault</description><name>3</name></values><values><description>Simple assault</description><name>4</name></values><values><description>Personal theft</description><name>5</name></values></fields><fields><description>A measure of whether victims received any help or advice from victim service agencies.

This weight also accounts for high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, which are six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe events in detail. BJS has decided to count series victimizations using the victim's estimate of the number of times the victimizations occurred during the prior 6 months, capping the number within each series at a maximum of 10 victimizations. Including series victimizations in national estimates can substantially increase the number and rate of violent victimization. However, trends in violence are generally similar regardless of whether series victimizations are included.</description><name>Victimization</name></values></fields><fields><description>Year of victimization</description><id>year</id><name>Year</name><values><description>Valid years</description><name>1993-2017</name></values></fields></bjsDataSetFields>\n"
